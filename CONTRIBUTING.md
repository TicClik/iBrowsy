- Consider the scope and feasibility

### Submitting Code Changes

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the coding standards below
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Build the project without warnings

   - Create a pull request with a clear description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Be responsive to feedback and review comments

## üìù Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guidelines

Follow these conventions to maintain code quality:

- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (not tabs)
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- **Comments**: Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Documentation**: Use Swift documentation comments for public APIs

### Code Organization

- Place files in appropriate feature folders
- Use MARK comments to organize code sections
- Follow the established architecture patterns
- Keep functions focused and small
- Avoid massive view controllers/models

### Example Code Style

```swift
// MARK: - Properties

@State private var isLoading: Bool = false
@AppStorage("user_preference") private var userPreference: String = ""

// MARK: - Body

var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 16) {
        // UI components
    }
    .onAppear {
        setupInitialState()
    }
}

// MARK: - Private Methods

private func setupInitialState() {
    // Implementation
}
```

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Use `@State` for local view state
- Use `@AppStorage` for user preferences
- Use `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` for complex state management
- Extract reusable components into separate views
- Use proper accessibility labels and hints

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Always test your changes manually:
- Run the app in different scenarios
- Test with and without API keys configured
- Verify accessibility features work
- Test on different screen sizes and resolutions

### Automated Testing

If adding new core functionality:
- Add unit tests for business logic
- Add integration tests for complex workflows
- Ensure tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document public APIs with Swift documentation comments
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functions

### README Updates

If your changes affect:
- Feature capabilities
- Installation instructions
- Usage guidelines
- System requirements

Please update the README.md accordingly.
